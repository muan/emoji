# CONTRIBUTING

Thanks for thinking about contributing to this project. :heart_eyes:

## What do you want to do?

#### JavaScript changes

Change the files in `/javascripts`.

#### CSS changes

The CSS is currently compiled from SCSS, so you will need to install and develop in SASS, then include the compiled CSS file in your commits.

## Coding Style

When in doubt, follow https://github.com/styleguide.
